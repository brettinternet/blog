I read and reread assignments, and I constantly evaluated my priorities to stay on task.\nI became obsessed with productivity. I was always looking out for the next shiny tool to help me get an edge in competitive learning.\nI‚Äôve used feature-rich apps like OmniFocus or Wunderlist and simpler tools like Apple Reminders.</p>\n<p>For a while I used Evernote for note-taking, then I tried OneNote, Apple Notes and even Google Keep.\nI left Evernote because they‚Äôd seemed to have lost their way with gimmicky features.\nI liked that OneNote didn‚Äôt force-feed a premium option and it was just as accessible as Evernote.\nLater, I thought that maybe Apple Notes would be just enough for me, but I eventually found that it wasn‚Äôt better for anything other than lists or using the touch draw feature.</p>\n<p>Now as a developer, I use markdown in my IDE.\nThis process for note-taking certainly isn‚Äôt novel ‚Äì you‚Äôll even find books on GitHub written with markdown.\nMarkdown offers the most formatting versatility, especially to display code excerpts with syntax highlighting and quickly reference links, create lists, and break notes out by sections.\nThis is especially true since GitHub‚Äôs flavoring and small enhancements have made markdown previewing so accessible. Even this blog is made using markdown.</p>\n<h3>Markdown</h3>\n<p>I love markdown.\nI like how widely support it is, and I like how clear markdown format is to convey information.\nMarkdown has become the ubiquitous plain text format for the GitHub community.\nMy own blog posts are written in markdown and compiled with <a href=\"https://github.com/brettinternet/minimaless/\">Jekyll</a>.</p>\n<h3>Git</h3>\n<p>Right now I have a <a href=\"https://bitbucket.org/brettinternet\">BitBucket</a> for my private repos and notes and I use GitHub for my <a href=\"https://github.com/brettinternet/public-notes\">public notes</a>.\nEventually, I‚Äôll set up my own Gitab to self-host my own repos.</p>\n<p>My commit messages are short, but they‚Äôre also meaningful so I can see my note history and refer back to find deleted excerpts. I also use <a href=\"https://github.com/brettinternet/dotfiles/blob/master/.aliases\">aliases</a> for git commands to make pushing to master very fast.</p>\n<h3>Desktop</h3>\n<p>I use Vim.\nTo me, taking notes in my editor environment is the best possible scenario since I‚Äôm most comfortable with the shortcuts.\nAtom is also a great option.\nIt has a markdown previewer you can access with <code class=\"language-text\">ctrl</code> + <code class=\"language-text\">shift</code> + <code class=\"language-text\">m</code>.\nThe big advantage with markdown is that just about anything can open it up and preview it.\nI‚Äôm no longer bound to an app‚Äôs platform to view my notes.</p>\n<p>I do very little clipping from the web.\nI tend to think that a simple bookmark is better.\nEverNote certainly has the strongest clipper, and I do like that OneNote‚Äôs web clipper is <a href=\"https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/onenotedev/2016/08/31/the-web-clipper-goes-open-source/\">open source</a>.\nThere are a few other open source alternatives that have been mentioned in the self-hosting subreddit, but I haven‚Äôt looked into them yet.</p>\n<h3>Mobile</h3>\n<p>Before I found <a href=\"https://workingcopyapp.com/\">Working Copy</a>, a solid mobile git solution for iOS was <em>the</em> missing piece for keeping notes in a git repo.\nI‚Äôm sure there are equally polished options on Android.\nWith Working Copy you can fetch repos for free, but you‚Äôll have to pay to unlock push.\nI think it‚Äôs worth it to support this developer.\nThe app supports SSH keys, language highlighting and markdown and plain text previews.\nIt‚Äôs an excellent mobile option and nearly an IDE for iOS.</p>\n<h3>Save Menu</h3>\n<p>It‚Äôs true, this method isn‚Äôt perfect.\nI need separate tools for sketches and pdf markups.\nBut these mediums make up about 0.5% of all my notes.\nI just use my ownCloud for storing files or Keybase for my public documents.</p>\n<p>However, markdown is certainly here to stay.\n<a href=\"https://githubengineering.com/a-formal-spec-for-github-markdown/\">Some recent specification</a> has been proposed to standardize Github‚Äôs flavor of markdown.\nOne of my favorite introductions to markdown can be found <a href=\"http://commonmark.org/\">here</a>.\nCommonmark was put together by a few representatives of some major techs like GitHub, Reddit, and Stack Exchange.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Everything not saved will be lost.</p>\n<p>- <em>Nintento ‚ÄúQuit Screen‚Äù message</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Like an accessible save menu, I keep everything in markdown.\nI record docker commands and obscure command-line arguments, JavaScript toy problems, or directions to setup Postgres permissions.\nI‚Äôll only make a note on it if it‚Äôs easier to reference my notes than it is to <a href=\"%7B%25%20post_url%202016-11-03-becoming-a-professional-googler%20%25%7D\">Google search it</a>.\nI also take notes to help out the students that I mentor. You can checkout my <a href=\"https://github.com/brettinternet/public-notes\">public notes</a> on GitHub.</p>\n<p>Apple Reminders still works for me with short term personal todos, and Trello for team projects.\nBut for notes, I like good ol‚Äô fashioned git and markdown.\nI use a private ~BitBucket~ GitHub repo for my personal notes, and a separate repo for my public notes.\nPerhaps you‚Äôll think I‚Äôm a monk or a Luddite for not choosing the prettiest new apps, but I believe this method is the strongest embrace of trustworthy technology.\nGit and markdown are two timeless tools that are sure to be around for a long time.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Manage Notes with Markdown and Git","date":"February 06, 2017","tags":["markdown","git"]}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/managing-notes-with-markdown-and-git/","previous":null,"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/play-and-visual-spotify-music-in-terminal/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Play and Visualize Spotify Music in Terminal with Mopidy and Ncmpcpp","tags":["music","cli"]}}}}}
