## Growth

<!-- https://cdixon.org/2015/05/12/exponential-curves-feel-gradual-and-then-sudden -->

## Alignment

I subscribe to the [SOA Manifesto](http://www.soa-manifesto.org/)

Honest, even when it's embarrassing.

Alignment in priorities can minimize [marginal costs](https://www.econlib.org/library/Topics/College/margins.html).

## Work environment

I really like programming, so I'm happy to work long nights in order to get the job done. But sometimes poor planning can take people away from their families. I'm interested in contributing to teams that are mindful of outside responsibilities and duty beyond the company's product.

I have found endless enjoyment from engineering software. At the height of my productivity, I find myself alongside support coworkers, . I even enjoy some of the more difficult parts, such as disagreement and feedback. When there is a healthy culture of improvement, then there's strategic benefit for both the business and its members.
