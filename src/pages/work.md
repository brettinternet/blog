Ideas, disagreement, merge requests -- I'm open to it all. [Come say hi](/contact/).

I work at [PDQ.com](https://www.pdq.com), where we're building tools that save system administrators loads of time by automating much of their workload. We work with admins from all over the world, and a few of them join our [weekly webcast](https://live.pdq.com) where some of my coworkers drink whiskey and discuss the product. [^1]

Here are some reasons why you might be interested in joining us:

- Our cross-functional teams work with **purpose** and interdisciplinary collaboration helps us **prioritize** the important work first. That's a huge win for our customers.
- Our nimble group of developers and support staff practice a _rigorous_ but also _adaptive_ implementation of Scrum. We are aggressively interested in making system administration just a few clicks away for amateurs and professionals alike.
- If it's true that employees don't leave jobs but rather managers, then it'd be hard to leave PDQ. Our dev manager is a wonderful mentor.
- When [COVID-19 in Utah](https://rt.live/us/UT) pushed companies to work remotely, PDQ responded seemlessly. We've found new ways to collaborate online and participate in remote team building activities.

If you're interested in learning more, [get in touch with me](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brettinternet/). Or, if you'd like to me to join your project and your priorities are similar to [mine](/career/), then take a look at [how to recruit me](/recruit/).

[^1]: Sometimes as early as 10 AM. Can you believe that?
