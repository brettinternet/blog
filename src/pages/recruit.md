Hi! ðŸ‘‹ I'm always open to new opportunities if it's right next step.

Finding the right fit in a company is important to both of us.

To help respond to boilerplate recruitment offerings, I've written some notes about my expectations for a position:

1. I am motivated by _growth_, _impact_, and _helping others_. Here's [what I care about in a company](/career/). Do our core values align?
1. I work tirelessly toward results. Lots of tasks in a backlog are important, but I'm interested in making sure we accomplish the <u>most important</u> tasks first to prioritize business outcomes. Do your teams deliver sustainable business value?
1. My family is important to me. Right now in my career, a healthy work-life balance makes me shy about actively looking for a new position. Does your company have Fridays off? <span class="text-sm">If not, you may want to come [see what it's like where I work](/work/) instead.</span>
1. I'm an evangelist for making software available to broader communities. I'm willing to bet that your company benefits from open source software. How do your developers **contribute to open source** efforts, even if in small ways?

Do I have potential to be successful at your company?
