NSSM seems to be the de facto solution for lots of folks, and in my experience is has been a very trustworthy tool on PC. I use NSSM for a few other apps on my media server like PlexPy, Sonarr and Plex Requests.</p>\n<h3>NSSM</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://nssm.cc/download\">NSSM</a> is the non-sucking service manager. I use <a href=\"https://chocolatey.org/\">Chocolately</a> to install NSSM.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">choco install -y nssm</code></pre></div>\n<p>Open an elevated command prompt as administrator. If youâ€™d like to use the NSSM GUI, simply use:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">nssm install</code></pre></div>\n<p>This will open up the NSSM GUI. Otherwise, like myself, you may just prefer a few commands on the CLI.</p>\n<p>The steps are simple, and theyâ€™ve been outlined <a href=\"https://www.jecal22.com/how-to-run-plex-media-server-as-a-windows-service-2/comment-page-1/\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>Here are some of my notes on additional <a href=\"https://github.com/brettinternet/public-notes/blob/master/devops/nssm.md\">NSSM commands</a>.</p>\n<h3>PMS as a Service</h3>\n<p>PMS as a Service is created by a Plex community member. Itâ€™s an incredibly simple <a href=\"https://github.com/cjmurph/PmsService/releases\">install</a>. Youâ€™ll have to enter your user credentials since the app needs an elevated status to manage a service.</p>\n<h3>Automatic Updates</h3>\n<p>If youâ€™re a Plex subscriber, there are frequent Plex updates. And if youâ€™ve elected to use PMS as a service, then you can also use this handy little piece of software, <a href=\"https://github.com/TechieGuy12/PlexServerAutoUpdater\">PlexServerAutoUpdater</a>, which will stop your PMS service, update Plex automatically on your command and restart the service afterwards. You do have to configure Plex to <code class=\"language-text\">Automatically download updates</code>, this can be done in the server settings. According to the developer, PlexServiceAutoUpdater:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ol>\n<li>Stops the Plex service.</li>\n<li>Stops any Plex processes that are running.</li>\n<li>Installs the latest update.</li>\n<li>Deletes the Run keys from the registry to prevent Plex from running outside of the service.</li>\n<li>Stops any Plex processes that are running after the update.</li>\n<li>Restarts the Plex service.</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<p>These steps are critical with Plex running as a service, because you donâ€™t want multiple instances of Plex running. You can read more about this software and how to use Task Scheduler to schedule your updates <a href=\"http://technicallyeasy.net/update-plex-automatically-running-plex-service/\">on the authorâ€™s blog</a>.</p>\n<p>While I frequently remote into my servers to see whatâ€™s going on, and I have <a href=\"https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf\">Telegraf</a> collecting status info on my servers, Iâ€™ll still occasionally find my media server down without my knowing - typically because of some Windows update that required an abrupt restart.\nClearly Windows 10 is not a server OS.\nIf you have the cashðŸ’°, Windows Server comes with some measures to prevent this. Eventually, Iâ€™ll set up all my media server apps on a linux box or run them in docker containers. Until then, running Plex Media Server as a service is exactly what I need.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Run Plex Media Server as a Service","date":"May 15, 2017","tags":["media","homelab"]}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/2017-05-15-run-plex-media-server-as-a-service/","previous":null,"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/2017-07-14-configure-pfsense-as-a-developer/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Configure pfSense as a Developer - Part 1","tags":["network","homelab","pfsense"]}}}}
